## Using Functional Components Challenge
Use what you've learned in the previous sections to complete the following challenge:
![challenge](./documentation/using-functional-components-challenge.png)


### Steps
Note: In the challenge template, React and axios have been pre-installed. You won't be required to run the command
`npx create-react-app my-app --use-npm`.

Follow Step 1 below instead:
1. Inside a folder named **src** you will find a file named **posts.json**, this file is required for later challenges.

2. In the terminal, cd into my-app and install the node packages, `npm install`, and then `npm start` to run your project.

3. Using the existing **Sidebar.js** file, create a functional component, **Sidebar**.
4. Import the component and call on it in your App.js file
5. Test this works with text: "it works!"
6. Replace the "It works!" text with the div tag and 3 empty < a > (as shown above).

Important: Click the hints button below if you get stuck.

Extra Step: You may be wondering why the styling of the 3 links looks a little unusual compared to what you might expect. This is because we've already supplied some CSS files which are already altering the layout of your content.

Take a moment to open the css folder (src > components > css) to review the css files already provided.
